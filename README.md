# Structured-Query-Language-SQL-
Structured Query Language is a standard Database language which is used to create, maintain and retrieve the relational database. Following are some interesting facts about SQL.

SQL is case insensitive. But it is a recommended practice to use keywords (like SELECT, UPDATE, CREATE, etc) in capital letters and use user defined things (liked table name, column name, etc) in small letters.
We can write comments in SQL using “–” (double hyphen) at the beginning of any line.
SQL is the programming language for relational databases (explained below) like MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, SQL Server, Postgre, etc. Other non-relational databases (also called NoSQL) databases like MongoDB, DynamoDB, etc do not use SQL
Although there is an ISO standard for SQL, most of the implementations slightly vary in syntax. So we may encounter queries that work in SQL Server but do not work in MySQL.
